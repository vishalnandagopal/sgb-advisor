                This is just a tool to maximize XIRR on interest payments, and
                to find possible arbritages between gold price IRL and the
                prices SGBs are trading at

                    The price of Gold when the SGB matures will be the same as
                    it is today. While this may sound dumb, any increase in the
                    price of gold should lead to a somewhat similar increase in
                    redemption prices of all SGBs. You way think that gold can
                    fall or increase in between, but that will affect
                    <b>all</b> gold investments, not just SGB
                </li>

                    You are interested in gold and have finalized on SGB as a
                    product, and are just confused among different SGBs
